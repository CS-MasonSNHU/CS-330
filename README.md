How do I approach designing software?
I start by defining the project’s goals and the roles of each component. For the brick-based 2D animation, I sketched out how bricks, circles, and the paddle would interact. Then I broke the work into smaller tasks, ensuring each part fit into the overall plan.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project improved my ability to design modular systems. I learned to keep each feature (such as rendering or collisions) in separate classes or functions. That way, changes in one area don’t break the entire code.

What design process did you follow for your project work, and how could it be applied in future work?
I used a step-by-step process: I created a simple version, tested it, and gradually added features like splitting circles and destructible bricks. This same approach—start simple, then refine—can be used in almost any future project.

How do I approach developing programs, and what new strategies did I use?
I like to build and test in small increments. A new strategy I used was writing shorter methods and reusing them in multiple places. This made my code more organized and easier to modify.

How did iteration factor into your development, and how has your approach evolved?
Iteration was key: after each addition, I tested and fixed issues before moving on. Early on, I wrote bigger chunks of code, but I learned to test smaller pieces frequently. This reduced bugs and made the final product more stable.

How can computer science help me reach my goals, and what did I gain from computational graphics?
Computer science broadens my opportunities by teaching logic, problem-solving, and creativity. Working with graphics sharpened my skills in geometry, rendering, and collisions. These can be applied in educational settings—like data visualization—or professional fields such as gaming and simulations.
